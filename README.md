Homework 9 (Psyc 9040B)
For this homework, I chose the following problem: 

"If we list all the natural numbers below ten that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Write a program to find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000." 

In order to solve this problem, we can use a Python program that iterates through all the numbers below 1000 and checks if each number is a multiple of 3 or 5. If it is, the number is added to a running total.
